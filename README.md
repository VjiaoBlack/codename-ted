## Overview
We are working with the idea of sailiboats racing to an objective. 

One of the sailboats is a pirate ship who is tasked with stealing the booty of the other sailboats. Each sailbot has to make it to the finish line with as much booty as possible.

If a sailboat loses all of its booty, it also loses the race.
