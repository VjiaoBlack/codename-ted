### For CMSC-23800: Game Construction, Spring '17 @UChicago

1. [Project Overview](#overview)
2. [Style Guide](#style-guide)

## Overview
We currently have two ideas:

1. A game of "tag" where players essentially take turns playing the role of "it", where they have to
tag other players while maintaining a fast pace.
2. Light bikes

## Style Guide
Check `sample.cpp` and `sample.h` for generic style guidelines.
